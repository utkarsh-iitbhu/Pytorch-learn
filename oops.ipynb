    "### 1. Class and Object\n",
    "**Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "**Object:** An instance of a class. Objects are the actual implementations of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Constructor\n",
    "A special method in Python classes (`__init__`) that initializes the object's attributes. It is automatically called when a new object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Decorators\n",
    "Functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are used to add functionality to an existing code in a reusable way. Commonly used decorators are `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Setters and Getters\n",
    "Methods used to access and update the values of private attributes. Getters retrieve the value, and setters modify the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Inheritance\n",
    "A mechanism where one class (child/subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Access Modifiers\n",
    "Control the accessibility of class members. In Python, these include:\n",
    "- **Public:** Accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "- **Protected:** Prefix with a single underscore `_`, suggesting it should not be accessed directly.\n",
    "- **Private:** Prefix with a double underscore `__`, making it inaccessible outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Static Methods\n",
    "Defined with `@staticmethod`, these methods do not require an instance of the class to be called. They do not modify class state or instance state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Instance vs Class Variables\n",
    "- **Instance Variables:** Defined within a method and belong to the instance of the class.\n",
    "- **Class Variables:** Defined within the class but outside any method. Shared across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Class Methods\n",
    "Defined with `@classmethod` and take `cls` as the first parameter. They can modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Class Methods as Alternative Constructors\n",
    "Class methods that provide alternative ways to create instances of the class. For example, a class method could create an instance from a different set of parameters than the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. dir, __dict__, help Method\n",
    "- **`dir()`:** Lists all attributes and methods of an object.\n",
    "- **`__dict__`:** A dictionary representation of an object's namespace.\n",
    "- **`help()`:** Provides a help page for an object, displaying its documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. super Keyword\n",
    "Used to call methods from a parent class. It is often used in the context of multiple inheritance to ensure that the parent class's method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Magic/Dunder Functions\n",
    "Special functions in Python with double underscores before and after their names (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`). They enable the customization of behavior for built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Method Overriding\n",
    "Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The new method in the subclass is used instead of the inherited one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Operator Overloading\n",
    "Allows custom implementation of operators for user-defined classes by defining special methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. Single Inheritance\n",
    "A class inherits from only one superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "A class inherits from more than one superclass, allowing it to combine behaviors and attributes from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. Method Resolution Order\n",
    "The order in which Python looks for a method in the hierarchy of classes. In multiple inheritance, it is defined using the C3 linearization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. Multi-level Inheritance\n",
    "A form of inheritance where a class is derived from another class, which is also derived from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. Hierarchical/Hybrid Inheritance\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Inheritance:** A combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. Abstract Classes and Methods\n",
    "Abstract classes in Python are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are meant to be inherited by other classes. Abstract methods are methods declared in the abstract class but without an implementation, which must be implemented by subclasses. The `abc` module is used to create abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. Interfaces\n",
    "Python does not have built-in support for interfaces like some other languages (e.g., Java). Interfaces in Python are often mimicked using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the `abc` module or using conventions where classes define certain methods that subclasses must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enhances flexibility and reusability by allowing a single interface to be used for different underlying forms (types).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in OOP that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Private and protected members are used to implement encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. Design Patterns\n",
    "Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide templates on how to solve particular design problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26. Composition\n",
    "Composition is a design principle in OOP where a class contains an object of another class as an instance variable. It allows building complex types by combining objects of other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27. Aggregation\n",
    "Aggregation is a specialized form of association where objects are assembled or configured together to create a more complex object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28. Duck Typing\n",
    "Duck typing is a concept related to dynamic typing, where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. It emphasizes methods and behaviors over strict type definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29. Type Hinting and Annotations\n",
    "Type hints and annotations provide a way to indicate the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values in Python code. They improve code readability and can be used by static analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30. Metaclasses\n",
    "Metaclasses in Python are classes whose instances are classes themselves. They allow customization of class creation behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31. Mixins\n",
    "Mixins are classes that provide methods to be inherited by other classes, but are not meant to stand alone. They enhance the functionality of a class without forcing inheritance from a single superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32. Property Decorators\n",
    "Property decorators in Python are used to define properties in classes. They allow computed or managed attributes to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 33. Custom Exceptions\n",
    "Custom exceptions allow developers to create their own error types to handle specific situations in their code, providing clarity and modularity in error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 34. Context Managers and the with Statement\n",
    "Context managers in Python allow the execution of code within a context, setting up and tearing down resources as needed. The `with` statement simplifies the management of these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35. Reflection and Introspection\n",
    "Reflection allows Python code to examine the attributes of objects at runtime. Introspection refers to the ability to determine the type of an object at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 36. Serialization\n",
    "Serialization is the process of converting objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted and later reconstructed. Python provides modules like `pickle` and `json` for serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 37. Persistent Objects\n",
    "Persistent objects refer to objects that are stored beyond the execution of a program. Techniques like object-relational mappers (ORMs) facilitate persistence in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38. Unit Testing OOP Code\n",
    "Unit testing is the practice of testing individual units or components of a software to ensure they function correctly. Frameworks like `unittest` and `pytest` support testing OOP code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39. SOLID Principles\n",
    "SOLID is an acronym for a set of principles aimed at making software design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 40. Dependency Injection\n",
    "Dependency injection is a design pattern where dependencies of a class are provided from the outside rather than created internally. It improves modularity and testability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41. Memory Management\n",
    "Memory management in Python involves automatic garbage collection, which frees up memory that is no longer in use by objects in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42. Garbage Collection\n",
    "Python's garbage collector automatically manages the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects, ensuring efficient memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",

    "\n",
    "rect = Rectangle(5, 10)\n",
    "print(\"Area of rectangle:\", rect.area())  # Output: Area of rectangle: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "circle = Circle(7)\n",
    "print(\"Area of circle:\", circle.area())   # Output: Area of circle: 153.86\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interfaces (Mimicked with ABC)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Interface(ABC):\n",

    "        print(\"Method implementation in MyClass\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "obj.method()  # Output: Method implementation in MyClass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",

    "make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof\n",
    "make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation (Using Private Members)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, speed):\n",
    "        self.__speed = speed  # private attribute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_speed(self):\n",
    "        return self.__speed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_speed(self, speed):\n",
    "        if speed < 0:\n",
    "            print(\"Speed cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.__speed = speed\n",
    "\n",
    "car = Car(100)\n",
    "print(car.get_speed())  # Output: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "car.set_speed(120)\n",
    "print(car.get_speed())  # Output: 120\n",
    "\n",
    "car.set_speed(-10)  # Output: Speed cannot be negative.\n",
    "print(car.get_speed())  # Output: 120 (speed remains unchanged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Patterns (Singleton)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    _instance = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __new__(cls):\n",

    "# Creating Command Line Utilities in Python\n",
    "Command line utilities are programs that can be run from the terminal or command line interface, and they are an essential part of many development workflows. In Python, you can create your own command line utilities using the built-in `argparse` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "Here is the basic syntax for creating a command line utility using `argparse` in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add command line arguments\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"arg1\", help=\"description of argument 1\")\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"arg2\", help=\"description of argument 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parse the arguments\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the arguments in your code\n",
    "print(args.arg1)\n",
    "print(args.arg2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "Here are a few examples to help you get started with creating command line utilities in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding optional arguments\n",
    "The following example shows how to add an optional argument to your command line utility:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"-o\", \"--optional\", help=\"description of optional argument\", default=\"default_value\")\n",
    "\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(args.optional)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Adding positional arguments\n",
    "The following example shows how to add a positional argument to your command line utility:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"positional\", help=\"description of positional argument\")\n",
    "\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(args.positional)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Adding arguments with type\n",
    "The following example shows how to add an argument with a specified type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"-n\", type=int, help=\"description of integer argument\")\n",
    "\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(args.n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Creating command line utilities in Python is a straightforward and flexible process thanks to the `argparse` module. With a few lines of code, you can create powerful and customizable command line tools that can make your development workflow easier and more efficient. Whether you're working on small scripts or large applications, the `argparse` module is a must-have tool for any Python developer.\n"

Dumazile originated from a cyclone Dyclone low-pressure area that formed near Agaléga on 27 February. It became a tropical disturbance on 2 March, and was named the next day after attaining tropical storm status. Dumazile reached its peak intensity on 5 March, with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), and a central atmospheric pressure of 945 hPa (27.91 inHg). As it tracked southeastwards, Dumazile weakened steadily over the next couple of days due to wind shear, and became a post-tropical cyclone on 7 March\n",
